            <h2>THE CHALLENGE</h2>
            <h3><strong>Who is paying attention to your health?</strong></h3>
            <p>Currently the concept of healthcare portals is backwards. Most of the time when people use health portals that are provided by their doctor or hospital, they may use it for a specific health issue – say an upcoming surgery – or if they are dealing with a chronic disease. Because the patient does not own these portals this information tends to get lost or not used consistently. </p>
          </div>

           <div class="one-half">
            <h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
            <h3> <strong>Take control of your health narrative.</strong></h3>
            <p>Provide an all-in-one health care application that is build for the individual and their family. Taking the ownership away from the doctor/hospital and putting it in the hands of the individual.<br/>
            
            Managing and tracking your health and health care information can be overwhelming and sometimes the biggest hurdle can simply be knowing where to start. The goal with Mandala Health is to help give you the core tools and resources needed to put you in the driver seat for you and your family’s health.

     <h2>USER SURVEYS</h2>
     <p>A survey was sent out to a group of individuals to gain insight about how they currently track their health information and what they would love to be able to track. There there 24 responses to this survey. 
     </p>

      <h3>INSIGHTS GAINED</h3>

        </div>
        
        <div class="endsur">
        <p>From the the survey I learned that there is a space for creating a personal health tracking and managagement system particularly for families. Living a healthly lifestyle is important to the majaority of participants and they do track health information but is not centralized and easily accessible. From the small percentage of people who utalize a web application it is one that is provided by their health care professional or a hospital. Of the array of desired information to track prescriptions, doctor's information and allergies topped the list of importance. Other product functionality that participants would love to see is tracking immunization for their children and receiving automatic text/email reminders for perscritions, appointments and more. Most participants felt comfortable placing health information on a web application as long as it was secure.</p>

                <p>An analysis of market competitors included Microsoft HealthVault, WebMD’s Health Manager and Caresync. I looked to see where there were strengths and weaknesses and what elements that I could find to help Mandala Health stand apart in the market place. Caresync was weakest overall but both Microsoft HealthVault and WebMD’s Health Manger were very extensive and solid established platforms.<p>


                <h3><strong>The main opportunity I saw for Mandela Health was to focus on a guided easy to follow getting started process, a strong dashboard and easy navigation especially switching to different family members and editing information.</strong></h3>

     <p>User stories were generated from survey findings, expert insights, competitive analysis and the goals and motivations of the user personas. <stong>Draw.io</stong> was then used to create user flows focusing on the getting started process, adding widgets, adding family members, and adding family health history. The focus of the user flows is having everything stem from the dashboard and helping users stay engaged with the application.</p>

<h2>UI DESIGN & BRAND IDENTITY</h2>
     
     <div class="one-half">
      <p>While in practice once an idea’s MVP is determined I create the brand for a project. This was not the case for Mandala Health.</p> 

    <p>Initially basic UI elements were established that helped create the pattern library. The goal for the UI of the platform was to feel trustworthy, clean and light. Bright blues and green were determined to be the main colors with a collection of secondary colors (red, orange, yellow, purple) to help with tracking and navigation and call to actions. A range of greys were used for supporting text and structure.</p>

    <p>My type system features Montserrat on the headers for its strong lines and prominent characters for exceptional readability. I use a lighter weight of Proxima Nova in the body to achieve more space between all other elements on screen.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="one-half">

    </div>

    <img class="user-flow" src="images/iMac-Flat-Mockup.png" alt="Mandala Health User Flow"/>


<p> Once the dashboard and main user flows were created I went back to explore the identity for this personal health management platform. I wanted to create a unique identity that would stand apart from what already existed in the health tech marketplace. This was a great challenge as many of my initial ideas explored already existed and I didn’t have a strong parent company to help build off like my competitors in Microsoft or WebMD.</p>

<p>In the end a loose geometric interpretation of “Mandala” was used to represent this health care application. Mandala is a geometric pattern that represents the universe, which fits the goals and desires for a personal health management system. Health was added to the brand name so users can easily identify that this is a health tech offering.</p>

<h4><strong>PREFERENCE TESTING THROUGH USABILITYHUB.COM</strong></h4>
<img class="user-flow" src="images/iMac-Flat-Mockup.png" alt="Mandala Health User Flow"/>
<p> I created a collection of the Mandala geometric pattern and tested my two favorite designs to determine which logo would be strongest for the web application. <strong>Version B</strong> was the clear winner with 90% of all votes calculated.</p>

<!--testing-->

<section class="user-flows">

<h2>Moderated User Testing</h2>
<p>I developed a script to interview three individuals who had similar trates to the user personas; a busy mom, a leader, and a proactive husband.</p>

<p>The focus of the interviews were to find out the strengths and mostly weaknesses of the below senerios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Signing up with Mandala Health</li> 
  <li>Recording family health history</li>
  <li>Adding a family member to the application</li> 
</ul>

<h4><strong>Testing Results</strong></h4>
<p>Overall I recieved positive feedback of the look and feel of the platform. Everyone liked the clean design and believed the platform felt secure. Each tester left feeling excited about wanting to be more proactive with their health and offered alot functionality to consider adding including syncing with other apps they currently use. Other elements that I asked for in questioning is finding out ways to keep them engaged, email and text communication was a popular response as this is a mode of communication they currently ultalized and find helpful.</p>

<p> The most valuable feedback in the moderated user testing was in the "getting started" process. Without guiding them all three participants struggled to realize that they had to scroll down the page to save and move to the next step, particulary while filling out the "Current Health" section. Another element that was overlooked was the ability to go back or review any information they had already inputted or being able seeing a final summary of their information. Also, the ability to save and come back at a different time was another suggestion that I will strongly consider in future development.</p>

<p> All these valuable insights validate how important this guided "getting started" process is and how challenging it can be to develop an effective way for users to fill out alot of information using forms. This information will be used to set up some additional user tests to determine button placement and how much information should be on each step of the multi-step getting started process.</p>
