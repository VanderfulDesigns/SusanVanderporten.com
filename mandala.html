            <h2>THE CHALLENGE</h2>
            <h3><strong>Who is paying attention to your health?</strong></h3>
            <p>Currently the concept of healthcare portals is backwards. Most of the time when people use health portals that are provided by their doctor or hospital, they may use it for a specific health issue – say an upcoming surgery – or if they are dealing with a chronic disease. Because the patient does not own these portals this information tends to get lost or not used consistently. </p>
          </div>

           <div class="one-half">
            <h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
            <h3> <strong>Take control of your health narrative.</strong></h3>
            <p>Provide an all-in-one health care application that is build for the individual and their family. Taking the ownership away from the doctor/hospital and putting it in the hands of the individual.<br/>
            
            Managing and tracking your health and health care information can be overwhelming and sometimes the biggest hurdle can simply be knowing where to start. The goal with Mandala Health is to help give you the core tools and resources needed to put you in the driver seat for you and your family’s health.

<h2>USER PERSONAS</h2>
     <p>Based off of survey results and a detailed interview with a leader in the health care industry three user personas were created to help streamline the goals and objectives in creating Mandala Health. </p>

            <p>Betsy is a busy stay at home mom. She is responsible for family records and is very organized.  Feels like she has all the important information tracked but never in one centralized place and worries that if anything were to happen if she is unavailable her husband wouldn’t know what to do. </p>

            <p>Leslie’s passion in life is to lead others to a better way of living (life coach). She lives a very healthy lifestyle, wears her Fitbit daily, monitors and tracks her diet and activity. She also plays an active role in her aging parents lives and makes sure they are on track with their medications and doctor visits. </p>

<h2>USER FLOWS & CARD SORTING</h2>

The three user stories that were focused on were:Guided Set Up, Family History Set Up, Adding a family Member.The dashboard was imperative to ensure success for these users flows.</p>
