     <h2>MY ROLE</h2>
     <p>ImPROve was created from my own challenge of absorbing new knowledge as I make strides in changing my career path from in-house marketing designer to UX designer/researcher. I often found myself nodding my head at Meetups while I inconspicuous wrote down a term to look up later. I also enjoy taking notes as I learn but rarely go back to review the "good stuff" I wrote down. Always being a fan of flashcards I thought creating a tool that is geared towards the career go-getter would be a fun and easy way to consume new knowledge.<p>

    <!--USER SURVEY-->
 

    <section class="user-survey">

     <h2>USER SURVEY</h2>
     

     <p>To ensure that a career driven flash card app would be a viable product a survey was sent out to a group of individuals. The focus of the survey was to discover how much time people spend learning about their career and the avenues at which they prefer to learn. I also focused on what functionality is most desirable for this application. There were 27 responses to this survey.</p>

      <h3>INSIGHTS GAINED</h3>

        <div class="one-fourth">
            <img src="images/improve_67.png" alt="67 Percent"/>
            <h4><strong>67% spend two or more hours on their phone a day</strong></h4>

        </div>

         <div class="one-fourth">
            <img src="images/improve_59.png" alt="59 Percent"/>
            <h4><strong>59% would consider using a career driven flash card app</strong></h4>
        </div>

         <div class="one-fourth">
            <img src="images/improve_77.png" alt="77 Percent"/>
            <h4><strong>77% say good content would keep them using a flash card app </strong></h4>
        </div>
        
        <div class="endsur">
        <p>From the survey I learned since the majority of respondents are spending multiple hours on their phone every day and a few hours a week learning about their profession there is a space for an application like ImPROve. Respondents use a variety of techniques to retain new knowledge including writing notes, taking quizzes and having discussions with others. Watching videos, reading blogs and going to events topped the list for preferred method of learning. Only one respondent would not consider using a flash card app and only a handful had attempted to use a flash card app in the past. One respondent expressed frustration trying multiple flash card apps but none were greatly designed. The key for a successful flash card app is ease of use and relevant material. “Good Content” was overwhelmingly the biggest motivator for respondents to come back to utilized the app again.

     <h2>COMPETITOR ANAYLSIS </h2>


         <div class="one-half">

              <p>An analysis of market competitors included Chegg’s Flashcard App, Quizlet and Brainscape. I looked to see where there were strengths and weaknesses and what functionality would help ImPROve stand apart in the market place.</p>

              <p>Overall each application is well designed. Quizlet was the strongest with helpful introductions, easy searching capabilities and intuitive quizzing options. Chegg’s Flashcard App was geared towards users in an education setting and Brainscape was the most difficult to figure out how to do anything. From exploring these applications, I saw a space for ImPROve especially if it is geared towards the professional community.</p>

              <p>The main opportunity I saw for ImPROve was to keep the design and functionality simple, especially in regards to searching and creating your own deck. I found in my research competitors had a lot of unnecessary frills and options taking the user away from the main purpose of learning from their shared or created flash card decks.</p>

<section class="user-flows">

<h2>USER STORIES & USER FLOWS</h2>
     <p>User stories were generated from survey findings, competitive analysis and the goals and motivations of the user personas.  Draw.io was then used to create user flows focusing on the setting up an account, creating a deck, searching a deck and going through a desk (specifically testing).</p>

<!--UI & BRAND-->


<section class="brand">

<h2>BRAND IDENTITY & UI DESIGN</h2>
     
     <p>The brand name ImPROve was created by combining the word “improve” and highlighting “PRO.” This word combination plays off of the idea that any career go-getter must always be “improving” their skills and knowledge in their industry to become the “PRO”fessional they strive to be. Along with the name – fonts, colors and icons were created to capture the feeling of professionalism and empowerment. A lighting bolt icon was used as the main logo mark, a symbol to ignite and excite the user to feel engaged with this flash card application. A blue monochromatic scheme was created for the application using deep midnight blues for the backdrop to bright blues for the logo and icon. Also, a collection of vibrant secondary colors were established for category icons. The logo was typeset in Noto Sans – a font that is designed with the goal of achieving visual harmony and is known as being a universal font. The typeface Open Sans was chosen for the rest of the copy on the application as a compliment to Noto Sans and for its excellent legibility.</p>

<section class="user-flows">

<h2>HIGH FIDELITY WIRE FRAMES & USER TESTING</h2>
<p>The branding was implemented into high fidelity wire frames which were based off of the user flows and initial wireframe sketches. </p>

<h4><strong>DASHBOARD PREFERENCE TESTING THROUGH USABILITYHUB.COM</strong></h4>



<p>While creating the high fidelity wireframes I found that there were multiple ways people may want to get information on their dashboard. Wanting to be certain the icons for action were clear and straight forward I created a preference test for users to determine which dashboard was easiest for them accomplish creating a new deck, searching for a deck and sharing a deck.</p>


<img class="user-flow" src="images/improve_dashboardtest.png" alt="ImPROve Dashboard Test"/>


<h4><strong>TEST RESULTS</strong></h4>
<p>The majority of testers believed that <strong>Option B</strong> worked best. Feedback included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Cleaner, and has the tools at the bottom to apply to the whole app.”</li> 
  <li>“I like the toggle buttons at bottom and use of my name.”</li>
  <li>“Easier to click actions at the bottom of the screen vs the top.”</li> 
</ul>

<!--conclusion-->



<section class="conclusion">

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>The beauty and challenge of mobile app design is keeping the interactions with the app as simple as possible. Through designing ImPROve I truly saw the value of defining the product MVP. Knowing what was necessary to get this application off the ground was helpful when determining what user flows I need to focus on. I also discovered how important it is to limit actions on the screen. If there are too many options or steps for the user to take there is a high percentage that they will become frustrated and leave the application and never return. </p>

<img src="images/improve_conclusion.png" alt="IMPROVE Conclusion"/>


</section>
<!--
<h2>FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>It is essential that getting started process is strong so users do not bail out at the very first interaction with the application and never return. I would want to conduct a sequence of user tests to ensure this initial process is streamlined and refined.</li>

   <li>The key to helping someone be proactive with Mandala Health is to keep them engaged with the platform. I would continue to research this concept of continual engagement especially with complex applications. What platforms are successful with engagement similar to a personal health management system and what do users say would help them stay engaged?</li>

    <li>Once the foundation of the product is refined I would want to expand the product offering to include syncing Mandala Health with other health applications like MapMyRun and wearable devices like Fitbit.</li>
