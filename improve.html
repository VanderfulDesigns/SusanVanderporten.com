     <h2>MY ROLE</h2>
     <p>ImPROve was created from my own challenge of absorbing new knowledge as I make strides in changing my career path from in-house marketing designer to UX designer/researcher. I often found myself nodding my head at Meetups while I inconspicuous wrote down a term to look up later. I also love taking notes as I learn but rarely go back to review the "good stuff" I wrote down. Always being a fan of flashcards I thought creating a tool that is geared towards the career go-getter would be a fun and easy way to consume new knowledge.<p>

    <!--USER SURVEY-->
 

    <section class="user-survey">

     <h2>USER SURVEY</h2>
     

     <p>To ensure that a career driven flash card app would be a viable product a survey was sent out to a group of individuals. The focus of the survey was to discover how much time people spend learning about their career and the avenues at which they prefer to learn. I also focused on what functionality is most desirable for this application. There were 27 responses to this survey.</p>

      <h3>INSIGHTS GAINED</h3>

        <div class="one-fourth">
            <img src="images/improve_67.png" alt="67 Percent"/>
            <h4><strong>67% spend two or more hours on their phone a day</strong></h4>

            <h4><strong>56% spend 2-4 hours a week learning about their profession</strong></h4>

         <div class="one-fourth">
            <img src="images/improve_59.png" alt="59 Percent"/>
            <h4><strong>59% would consider using a career driven flash card app</strong></h4>
        </div>

         <div class="one-fourth">
            <img src="images/improve_77.png" alt="77 Percent"/>
            <h4><strong>77% say good content would keep them using a flash card app </strong></h4>
        </div>
        
        <div class="endsur">
        <p>From the survey I learned since the majority of respondents are spending multiple hours on their phone every day and a few hours a week learning about their profession there is a space for an application like ImPROve. Respondents’ use a variety of techniques to retain new knowledge including writing notes, taking quizzes and having discussions with others. Watching videos, reading blogs and going to events topped the list for preferred method of learning. Only one respondent would not consider using a flash card app and only a handful had attempted to use a flash card app in the past. One respondent expressed frustration trying multiple flash card apps but none were greatly designed. The key for a successful flash card app is ease of use and relevant material. “Good Content” was overwhelmingly the biggest motivator for respondents to come back to utilized the app again.

     <h2>COMPETITOR ANAYLSIS </h2>


         <div class="one-half">

              <p>An analysis of market competitors included Chegg’s Flashcard App, Quizlet and Brainscape. I looked to see where there were strengths and weaknesses and what functionality would help ImPROve stand apart in the market place.</p>

              <p>Overall each application was decently designed. I felt that Quizlet was the strongest with helpful introductions, easy searching capabilities and intuitive quizzing options. Chegg’s Flashcard App was geared towards users in an education setting and Brainscape was the most difficult to figure out how to do anything. From exploring these applications, I saw a space for ImPROve especially if it is geared towards the professional community.</p>

              <p>The main opportunity I saw for ImPROve was to keep the design and functionality simple, especially in regards to searching and creating your own deck. I found in my research competitors had a lot of unnecessary frills and options taking the user away from the main purpose of learning from their shared or created flash card decks.</p>

<h2>UI DESIGN & BRAND IDENTITY</h2>
     
     <div class="one-half">
      <p>While in practice once the MVP offering is determined I create the brand for a project. This was not the case for Mandala Health.</p> 

    <p>Initially basic UI elements were established that helped create the pattern library. The goal for the UI of the platform was to feel trustworthy, clean and light. Bright blues and green were determined to be the main colors with a collection of secondary colors (red, orange, yellow, purple) to help with tracking and navigation and call to actions. A collection of greys were used for supporting text and structure.</p>

    <p>My type system features Roboto Condensed for the headers for its strong geometric lines and exceptional readability. I use a lighter weight of Roboto Light for the body content.</p>

    <div class="one-half">
    <img class="brandui" src="images/mandala_brand.png" alt="Mandala Health Brand"/>
    </div>


<div class="brand2">
<p> Once the dashboard and main user flows were created I went back to explore the identity for this personal health management platform. I wanted to create a unique identity that would stand apart from what already existed in the health tech marketplace. This was a great challenge as many of my initial ideas already existed and I didn’t have a strong parent company to help build my platform from like my competitors in Microsoft or WebMD.</p>

<p>In the end a loose geometric interpretation of “Mandala” was used as the logo icon and the name for this health application. Mandala is a geometric pattern that represents the universe, which fits the goals and desires for a personal health management system. Health was added to the brand name so users can easily identify that this is a health tech offering.</p>

<h4><strong>PREFERENCE TESTING THROUGH USABILITYHUB.COM</strong></h4>
<img class="preference-test" src="images/mandala_preference.png" alt="Mandala Health Preference test"/>
<p> I created a collection of the Mandala geometric pattern and tested my two favorite designs to determine which logo would be strongest. <strong>Version B</strong>was the clear winner with 90% of all votes calculated.</p>

<section class="user-flows">

<h2>MODERATED USER TESTING</h2>
<p>A script was developed to run moderated user tests. I conducted this test on three individuals who had similar traits to the user personas; a busy mom, a leader, and a proactive husband.</p>

<p>The focus of the interviews were to find out the strengths and mostly weaknesses of the below senerios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Signing up with Mandala Health</li> 
  <li>Recording family health history</li>
  <li>Adding a family member to the application</li> 
</ul>

<h4><strong>Testing Results</strong></h4>
<p>Overall I received positive feedback of the look and feel of the platform. Everyone liked the clean design and believed the platform felt secure. Each tester left expressing their desire to be more proactive with their health and offered a lot functionality to consider including syncing with other apps they currently use. Other elements that I asked for in questioning is finding out ways to keep them engaged, email and text communication was a popular response as this is a mode of communication they currently utilized and find helpful.</p>

<p> The most valuable feedback in the moderated user testing was in the "getting started" process. Without guiding them all three participants struggled to realize that they had to scroll down the page to save and move to the next step, particularly while filling out the "Current Health" section. Another element that was overlooked was the ability to go back or review any information they had already inputted or being able to see a final summary of their information. Also, the ability to save and come back at a different time to complete the process was another suggestion that I will strongly consider in future development.</p>

<p> All these valuable insights validate how important this guided getting started process is and how challenging it can be to develop an effective way for users to fill out a lot of information using forms. This information will be used to set up some additional user tests to determine button placement and how much information should be on each step of the multi-step getting started process.</p>

<section class="conclusion">

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>Healthcare is overwhelming and complex and there is a real need to turn health care on its head and help individuals be proactive instead of reactive in their health. While in my discovery people would use a product like Mandala Health, there is still a disconnect in seeing the value in this product vs. actually using the product. The challenge is discovering how to help users feel this is a benefit in their lives vs. a burden and too hard to manage. </p>

<h2>FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>It is essential that getting started process is strong so users do not bail out at the very first interaction with the application and never return. I would want to conduct a sequence of user tests to ensure this initial process is streamlined and refined.</li>

   <li>The key to helping someone be proactive with Mandala Health is to keep them engaged with the platform. I would continue to research this concept of continual engagement especially with complex applications. What platforms are successful with engagement similar to a personal health management system and what do users say would help them stay engaged?</li>

    <li>Once the foundation of the product is refined I would want to expand the product offering to include syncing Mandala Health with other health applications like MapMyRun and wearable devices like Fitbit.</li>
